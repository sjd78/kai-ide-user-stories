## Wireframes

  0. <a name="wf-0"></a>Layout / display areas of the IDE

      ![ide layout](./wireframe/0.ide-layout.excalidraw.svg)

  1. <a name="wf-1"></a> Output channel for displaying trace/debug information
      - Multiple channels are ok as long it is obvious what each channel will display.  There may be technical/debug value in having a channel for:
        - extension processing (settings, start, stop, restart of the server)
        - analyzer processing
        - Kai processing

      ![output channel](./wireframe/1.outputchannel.excalidraw.svg)

  2. <a name="wf-2"></a>Command palette
      - Every entity (command, quick pick menu, and view) that is available in the extension should have a command palette entry to activate/display the entity

# More Details



## Walkthrough for configuration points
> [!NOTE]
> All of the settings will drop in `settings.json` or similar file.  Therefore, all of the settings could also be configured under the standard Settings view (Ctrl+,) or directly in the json file.

About the UX for the Walkthrough...
  - multi-step checklist featuring rich content
  - when a step is activated, a brief action description with links and action buttons are presented under the step text while a longer image/description is displayed to the right
  - most actions will:
    - open an external URL
    - run a command
    - open a quick pick menu
    - open view, panel or editor

Walkthrough steps:
  1. Guided setup of the Kai runtime (Wizard based?)
    Steps:
      - Select between:
        - runtime included in the extensions
        - external/custom runtime (portable app version and installed versions probably look the same to the extension so no need to differentiate the experience on that)

      - Configure the non-analyzer runtime settings

      - Verify the Kai runtime can be started (this is the "test the runtime starts and a simple ping/ack message is working" action):
        - Startup the server and ping/ack or check/good-to-go
        - Verify/configure any needed external runtimes or libraries
          - Check java
          - Check maven
          - Any other runtimes that would be needed by the supported providers?


  2. Manage analysis configuration profiles as a custom webview in the editor space
      - View a list packaged profiles
      - View the details of a single profile
      - Create a new empty profile
        - (details of the fields and what is required depends on the Kai-server)
      - Duplicate an existing profile
      - Remove a user created profile
        - (new empty or duplicated profiles only -- keep packaged profiles around)


  3. Select an analysis configuration profile
      - Pick one from a quick pick menu
      - Open the profile manager
      - Note: This action may be invoked from many other places


# Questions

  - Q? Can an analysis be running on a different loop than Kai resolutions?  This would imply there should be separate status indicators for each side of the tool.

  - Issue view, will it look like a patternfly page or can it be made to look like vscode?  Some vscode webcomponents are available to use from different packages.  They're just not react.
